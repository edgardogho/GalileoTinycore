Some older Galileo boards won't boot from SD.
In order to fix it, you need to update the firmware stored on the SPI 64Mbit Memory.
The latest firmware can be downloaded from here:
http://downloadmirror.intel.com/24355/eng/Flash-missingPDAT_Release-1.0.4.bin

Be aware that this firmware is not ready to be flashed using SPI. It will work but some markers needed to identify the board (Board Type and Mac Address) are not present in this file.
In order to fix this, Intel provides some tools on its BSP. In particular, you need to use platform-data (part of spi-flash-tools-1.2.1.1).
First copy the sample-platform-data-ini into yourfile.ini. Edit this file to match you board (Gen1, Gen2, MacAddress).
Then run: python platform-data-patch.py -p yourfile.ini -i Flash-missingPDAT_Release-1.0.4
That will patch the Flash Image with your platform data. It will create  a new file named Flash+PlatformData.bin

There are a few different ways to flash this, but I use BusPirate v3.6 (https://www.seeedstudio.com/bus-pirate-v3-assembled-p-609.html?cPath=61_68 ) and Flashrom.
The pinout of the connector is:
   3v3  O O  Gnd
    CS  O O  Clk
  Miso  O O  Mosi
          O  NC

The BusPirate will supply power to the SPI chip, so DO NOT connect the galileo power supply while updating the SPI flash.
With flashrom simply run:
flashrom --programmer buspirate_spi:dev=/dev/ttyUSB0 -f -n --write Flash+PlatformData.bin

It will take a long time (about an hour ... a little less if using -n). 

If you have a PICKit 2 programmer, it can also be used to program the SPI Flash. Make sure you get the latest flashrom (you might need to compile it).
