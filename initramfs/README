These are the files modified from tinycore initramfs (core.gz)

Download Tinycore 7.x initramfs from:
http://www.tinycorelinux.net/7.x/x86/release/distribution_files/core.gz

####You can modify the initramfs by creating a temp folder and doing:
##   Copy core.gz to /tmp
cp /path/to/core.gz /tmp/core.gz
cd /tmp

##   Become root and deploy the CPIO file so it can be modified
sudo su
mkdir work
gunzip core.gz
cd work
cpio -idmuv < ../core

##   At this point, all the initramfs is deployed on /tmp/work
##   Modify the files listed in here
##   Remove tinycore built-in kernel modules located on /tmp/work/lib/modules/*
##   Install all kernel modules running (after make bzImage, make modules)
make INSTALL_MOD_PATH=/tmp/work modules_install

##   In order to work with tinycore, galileo needs to output a console on ttyS1 (serial port #1).
##   Make sure you modify tinycore Initramfs with the files on /etc (inittab) so that serialport 1
##   puts a terminal

##   As an extra, we can force g_serial to load, and create a virtual serial port using the USB device interface
##   This way, we can access the Galileo Board using just a USB cable (no need to USB-Serial Interface).
##   In order to use this, copy the bootlocal.sh script from /opt to the initramfs. It will load the required modules.
##   This is very convenient. Just use a USB cable on the device interface, connect to a computer and turn on the Galileo.
##   Hotplug might not work. The terminal will prompt for login when connected.
##   If you want to use this virtual serial port as a regular serial port (no linux terminal on it), just comment the line
##   of bootlocal.sh that inits the terminal (leave the module load part), and you can use it as a regular serial port on
##   /dev/ttyGS0

##   Kernel modules should be on /tmp/work/lib/modules/KERNEL_VERSION-ltsi-tinycore+
##   After making all desired modification, generate the compress CPIO file again
cd /tmp/work
find . | cpio -oH newc | gzip -2 > ../core.gz

##  The initramfs can be copied to the microSD card now
